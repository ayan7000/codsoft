-----------------------------------------------Level 1 Task 1:Landing Page--------------------------->
I created a visually appealing landing page using HTML and CSS for the theme "Discover Lakshadweep," a travel destination. The page is designed to showcase the beauty and attractions of Lakshadweep, featuring high-quality images, engaging content, and an intuitive layout. HTML was used to structure the content, while CSS was applied to style the page, ensuring a responsive design that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Key features of the landing page include:

Hero Section: An eye-catching banner image that introduces Lakshadweep as a travel destination.
Responsive Design: The page adjusts smoothly for various screen sizes, providing an optimal experience across devices.
Engaging Content: Descriptions and images highlighting the island’s unique attractions.
This project helped me practice creating a visually compelling and user-friendly web page using front-end technologies.
